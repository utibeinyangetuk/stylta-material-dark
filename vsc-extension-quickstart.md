## What's in the Folder üìÇ

- This folder contains all of the files necessary for your color theme extension.
- [`package.json`](https://github.com/TylerAustInW/stylta-material-dark/blob/main/package.json) - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the theme file and specifies the base theme of the theme.
- [`themes/stylta material dark-color-theme.json`](https://github.com/TylerAustInW/stylta-material-dark/blob/main/themes/stylta%20material%20dark-color-theme.json) - the color theme definition file.

## Get Up and Running Straight Away üöÄ

- Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
- Open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick your color theme.
- Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these scopes, invoke the `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).<br>
  More information at [Syntax-Highlight-Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide) For `Tokens and Scopes`
  <br>

## Adopt Your Theme to Visual Studio Code üé®

- The token colorization is done based on standard TextMate themes. Colors are matched against one or more scopes.

To learn more about scopes and how they're used, check out the [color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme) documentation.

## Install Your Theme üíª

- To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code, copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
- To share your extension with the world, read on [publishing an extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) on the Visual Studio Code documentation.
